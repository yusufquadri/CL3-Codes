# Linear Congruential Generator is the simplest & oldest
# for LCG, the values of a,c & m may be anything but for it's full potential (i.e. longest unrepeated sequence) ->
# c & m should be co-prime (means they have no common factor other than 1)
# (a-1) should be divisible by all prime factors of m
def LCG() :
    global seed # Python would otherwise create a local seed in the next statement instead of using the global seed
    seed = (a * seed + c) % m
    return seed
